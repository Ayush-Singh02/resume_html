                <h3>&#x25CB; Document Management and Processing System on AWS</h3><p>
                     Deployed a secure and scalable document management and processing system on AWS using a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with multiple subnets to ensure network isolation and high availability. Implemented encrypted document storage using Amazon S3 and automated serverless processing through AWS Lambda triggered by document events. Secured the application by configuring Security Groups and restricting Amazon RDS (MySQL) access exclusively to the application layer hosted on Amazon EC2, following the principle of least privilege. Established centralized logging and monitoring using Amazon CloudWatch to track system performance, logs, and metrics. The solution leveraged AWS VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda for efficient cloud deployment.
                </p>
                <h3>&#x25CB; EDU-GENIE APP</h3><p>
                    Developed an AI-powered Android application using Java and the Android SDK with a strong focus on responsive UI/UX design and scalable architecture. Integrated Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database to enable secure user sign-in and efficient real-time data management. Implemented robust backend logic to ensure reliability and scalability of the application. Followed software development best practices, including version control with Git/GitHub and component-level testing using Android Studio. The technology stack included XML, RESTful APIs, Firebase, Java, and TensorFlow.
